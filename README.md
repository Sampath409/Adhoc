Machine Learning Based Approach Detecting Position Falsification Attack.

I used VeReMi Dataset to build the machine learning model to detect "Falsification Attack".

Guys So far, I hope you all worked on dataset which has lakhs of records but this is the dataset you have crores of records so you can build amazing models.

Data.csv file has only 10 lakhs of records because due to filesize limit in git.
You can download data from my drive "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16TBZUgquglKSbYl618PSVGVC1yrls_CC?usp=sharing"
Even if you download data from my drive it has 80 lakhs records, 
if you need more data you can visit following site and download  https://veremi-dataset.github.io/

I build classication models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network(ANN).
You can try svm, Random Forest, Boosting algorithms,.. then you can get superb results.

If your interst to know more about this project, you can go through "Machine Learning Based Approach to Detect Position Falsification Attack in VANETs" pdf.
